# Catan Rules Q&A

## What is Catan?

Catan, also known as The Settlers of Catan, is a popular board game designed by Klaus Teuber. It is a strategy game where players compete to establish settlements, trade resources, and expand their territories on the fictional island of Catan.

## How is the game set up?

1. **Board Setup:**
   - Place the hexagonal terrain tiles in a random layout to form the island of Catan.
   - Each tile represents a resource (wood, brick, ore, wheat, and sheep), with numbers indicating the likelihood of resources being produced.

2. **Settlements and Roads:**
   - Players take turns placing two settlements and two roads on the intersections and edges of the tiles.
   - Settlements should be at least two intersections away from each other.

3. **Initial Resource Production:**
   - Each player receives resources based on the numbers rolled for their initial settlements.

## How does the game progress?

1. **Rolling the Dice:**
   - On a player's turn, they roll two six-sided dice.
   - The number rolled determines which hexes produce resources. All players with settlements adjacent to these hexes receive corresponding resources.

2. **Resource Trading:**
   - Players can trade resources with each other before or after their turn.
   - They can also trade with the bank.
